# Hangman-Game

       This is a simple hangman game with an old-school terminal theme. It was written in Javascript. To play, just guess a letter by typing your guess on your keyboard. If you guess incorrectly 10 times, you lose. If you guess the word before that happens, you win. After you win or lose, you can restart the game by pressing any key on the keyboard.
